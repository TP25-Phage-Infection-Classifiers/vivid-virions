    "**Cross-Validation Strategy: Leave-One-Group-Out**\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the generalization capability of our models and to avoid overfitting, we employed the leave-one-group-out cross-validation strategy as implemented in scikit-learn. In this approach, each dataset —corresponding to a specific phage— is used once as the test set (singleton), while the remaining datasets collectively form the training set. This ensures that, in each split, the model is validated on data from a phage that was not seen during training, providing a robust assessment of performance across different biological backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "The data was not explicitly stratified according to the classification classes (\"early\", \"middle\", \"late\") during the splitting process as that is not part of the leave-one-group-out strategy. As a result, the distribution of these classes may vary between the training and test sets in each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overview of the class distribution in the training and test sets for each split is provided in\n",
    "leave_one_group_out_split/overview.tsv.\n",
    "\n",
    "All corresponding training and test files for each split are saved in\n",
