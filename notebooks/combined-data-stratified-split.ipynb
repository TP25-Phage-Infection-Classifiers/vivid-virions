    "We combined all phage feature tables into one large dataset and split it into 80% training and 20% test data using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` with stratification on the `classification` label.    \n",
    "The resulting files are saved in `data/combined-data-stratified-split/`. We checked that the split preserved the distribution of the three different classes (`early`, `middle`, `late`) and that no gene appears in both training and test sets.  "
